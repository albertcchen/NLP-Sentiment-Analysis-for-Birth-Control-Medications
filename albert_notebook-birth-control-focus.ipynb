Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&amp;#039;t know if I&amp;#039;ve lost weight (I don&amp;#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.\"   \n",

Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping!

Well I started freaking out and took the pill 40 min after. Tuesday morning I did feel some of the side effects but nothing too major!! Your period is either going to be early or late but i wasn&#039;t supposed to get my period until 2 weeks from the day I had sex. Fortunately I got it early six days later so it does work!! Also they say that if you weigh more then 160 or so it won&#039;t be as effective and well I&#039;m a pretty curvy girl I weigh 250 and it worked on me so Don&#039;t believe that stupid theory!!!

Insertion was uncomfortable but removal was way worse. I went in thinking that removal was going to be this quick painless thing, but that did not happen. The doctor could not locate the string, so she had to do an ultrasound to make sure it was still in place. It was there alright but the string was cut way to short.

I haven&#039;t gained a single pound from being on it. My periods are have still come but they are super light and last about 3 days, they are also sporadic but I don&#039;t blame it too much since before my periods used to last 7 days and were sporadic anyways.I have little to no cramping and when I do cramp it lasts about 3 days and usually the 3 days I lightly bleed. Also every now and then I check for the strings and they are always there in place. The reason I am giving it 9/10 is because how many stories I hear about having to have surgery and it makes me stress about what if.\"   \n",

I expected pressure during the insertion process but I felt pain. On a scale from 1 to 10 it was a strong 6. I may have a high pain tolerance because my doctor laughed &amp; said when she got hers she started cursing at the ceiling. Right after I felt fine &amp; the nurse looked at me funnily. A couple of hours later I knew why. She expected me to have some severe cramping immediately after - but it took my uterus an hour to deliver those. They lasted through the night. It&rsquo;s been almost a week and everything is okay! Using condoms until my OB is sure the IUD is in the right place.\"   \n",
